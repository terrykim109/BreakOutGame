Breakout was a popular arcade game that came out in the 70's, programmed by Steve Wozniak and designed by Atari. 

It also happened to be one of the projects for the CS106A Programming Methodology Class from Stanford. Unfortunately, their acm library was not compatible with my computer, but made use of their base code template to start building the game based on Java while using more modern Java libraries.
